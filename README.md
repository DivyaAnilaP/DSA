# DSA

Hola Everyone! 👋
Thanks for stopping by and checking out my codespace.

Here you’ll find my collection of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) solutions, mostly covering problems that are frequently asked in top-tier product companies.

💡 A few notes:

All solutions are written in Python 🐍.

They’re designed to be clean, optimized, and beginner-friendly.

The code can often be copy-pasted directly to platforms like LeetCode, but remember—the goal is to learn, not just paste 😉.

So dive in, explore, and happy coding! ✨
